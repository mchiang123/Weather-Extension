# CS50 Final Project: Sweater Weather

Ever have trouble dressing for the weather? Sweater Weather is a popup that displays the weather conditions at your current location and makes clothing recommendations. It's convenient: anytime you want to see how the weather is outside, click on the Sweater Weather icon and weather information, along with what you should wear, will appear in a non-disruptive popup.
